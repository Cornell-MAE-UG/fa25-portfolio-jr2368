## Aircraft Pitch Controller

For my System Dynamics course **MAE 3260**, I collaborated with Nicholas Schneider, Kat Volkova, and Lea Staller to design the pitch-control performance requirements of a Boeing 747-700 aircraft.

Our team developed a full **Simulink model** implementing a **PID controller** to regulate pitch angle under dynamic conditions. The system construction included:

- Deriving longitudinal aircraft dynamics  
- Building a linearized model for controller development  
- Designing and tuning PID gains  
- Running step-response and disturbance simulations  

This project strengthened my understanding of stability, feedback control, system identification, and real-world aircraft dynamics.
