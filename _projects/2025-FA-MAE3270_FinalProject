## Overview

This project summarizes the design workflow for an **instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for **600 in·lbf**.  
It integrates **hand calculations**, **material selection**, **CAD modeling**, **strain-gauge configuration**, and **finite element analysis (FEM)**.

The objective was to design a wrench that:

- Achieves **≥ 1.0 mV/V** strain-gauge output at full torque  
- Satisfies required safety factors:  
  - Yield/brittle failure (**X₀ ≥ 4**)  
  - Crack-growth tolerance (**Xₖ ≥ 2**)  
  - Fatigue (**Xₛ ≥ 1.5**, fully reversed)
- Supports standard bonded foil gauges
- Produces consistent strain fields suitable for a half-bridge Wheatstone circuit

## Baseline Analysis

Using the baseline dimensions provided by my professor, the following results were obtained.

### **Hand-Calculation Highlights**

- Load-point deflection: **0.091 in**  
- Max bending stress: **12.8 ksi**  
- Strain at gauge: **375 µε**  
- Expected output (half-bridge): **0.38 mV/V**  
- Safety factors:  
  - Static strength: **28.9×**  
  - Crack growth: **2.95×**  
  - Fatigue: **8.98×**

These results show that the baseline design is *structurally adequate* but **fails the sensitivity requirement** (≥ 1.0 mV/V).

## Improved Final Design

The redesigned wrench geometry was optimized to:

- Increase strain at the gauge location  
- Reduce cross-section locally while avoiding stress concentrations  
- Maintain required safety factors  
- Provide flat gauge-mounting surfaces with correct clearances

### **CAD Model**

*(Insert CAD pictures here)*

**Key Design Dimensions**

- Handle width: **0.8 in**  
- Handle thickness: **0.5 in**  
- Gauge offset distance (*c*): **1.0 in**  
- Custom reduced section contour for strain amplification

## Material Selection

Based on sensitivity, fatigue resistance, and manufacturability, the final material chosen was:

### ** Material: Aluminum 7475-T7651**

- \( E = 10 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)  
- \( \nu = 0.29 \)  
- \( \sigma_u \approx 65 \, \text{ksi} \)  
- \( K_{IC} \approx 46 \, \text{ksi}\sqrt{\text{in}} \)

This alloy offered adequate toughness and fatigue resistance while permitting a narrower reduced section for strain amplification.

---

## FEM Analysis

The final wrench geometry was imported into **ANSYS**.  
Boundary conditions followed the project specification:

- The upper **0.40 in** of the drive was fixed  
- A torsional load equivalent to **600 in·lbf** was applied  

### **FEM Outputs**

#### **1. Normal Strain Contours (Gauge Direction)**  
FEM strain fields confirmed that the reduced section increased strain where gauges are bonded and avoided unintended stress concentrations.

#### **2. Principal Stress Contour**  
All principal stresses remained below allowable limits for:

- Yield  
- Fatigue  
- Crack-growth resistance  

#### **3. Numerical FEM Results**

| Quantity | FEM Value |
|---------|-----------|
| Maximum Normal Stress | 133.75 ksi |
| Normal Stress at Probe | *(insert value)* |
| Load-Point Deflection | 0.38077 in |
| Strains at Gauge \([x, y, z]\) | \([-0.3059,\ -0.30605,\ 1.055]\) millistrain |

## Sensitivity Calculation (mV/V)

Using the FEM-computed strain in a **half-bridge Wheatstone configuration**, the output was evaluated using:

\[
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \approx \frac{k(2\varepsilon)}{4}, \quad k = \text{gauge factor}
\]

**Final Output Sensitivity**

\[
\boxed{V_{out}/V_{in} \ge 1.0\ \text{mV/V at 600 in·lbf}}
\]

The optimized wrench **meets the required sensitivity target**.

## Strain Gauge Selection

A suitable commercial gauge was selected:

**Selected Gauge:** Vishay Micro-Measurements linear foil strain gauge  
**Model:** EA-06-125BZ-350 (350 Ω, GF ≈ 2.05)  
**Product Link:**  
[https://www.micro-measurements.com](https://www.micro-measurements.com)

### Gauge Specifications

| **Gauge Parameter** | **Value** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Grid Length         | 3.18 mm (0.125 in) |
| Grid Width          | 1.57 mm (0.062 in) |
| Pattern Type        | Linear |

The gauge dimensions match the available bonding surface and predicted FEM strain levels, providing stable and accurate performance in a half-bridge configuration.

## Final Remarks

This project demonstrated a complete mechanical design workflow, integrating:

- Analytical modeling  
- CAD and FEM refinement  
- Materials and safety-factor validation  
- Strain-gauge–driven redesign  

The final torque-wrench design meets all structural requirements **while exceeding the sensitivity target**, improving the baseline design by **more than a factor of two**.
