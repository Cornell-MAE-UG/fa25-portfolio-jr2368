## Project Overview

This project involved designing an instrumented **3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for  
**600 in·lbf**, integrating analytical calculations, CAD modeling, strain-gauge placement,  
and ANSYS finite-element validation.

The wrench was required to meet:

- Sensitivity ≥ 1.0 mV/V  
- Yield/brittle failure safety factor X₀ ≥ 4  
- Crack-growth safety factor Xₖ ≥ 2  
- Fatigue safety factor Xₛ ≥ 1.5  
- Compatibility with standard bonded foil strain gauges  
- Manufacturability with consistent, repeatable strain fields  

---

## Baseline Analysis

Using the assigned baseline dimensions, the following performance metrics were obtained:

- Deflection at the load point: **0.091 in**  
- Maximum bending stress: **12.8 ksi**  
- Strain at gauge: **375 µε**  
- Estimated output for a half-bridge: **0.38 mV/V**

### Baseline Safety Factors

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Failure Mode</th><th>Safety Factor</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Static Strength</td><td>28.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crack Growth</td><td>2.95</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fatigue</td><td>8.98</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The baseline design is structurally adequate, but it **does not meet the sensitivity requirement**, which motivates a geometry update to increase strain at the gauge location.

## Improved Final Design

The redesigned geometry focuses on:

- Introducing a reduced cross-section to amplify measurable strain  
- Preserving yield, fatigue, and fracture safety factors  
- Providing flat, accessible regions for strain-gauge bonding  
- Ensuring that strain gradients near the gauges remain smooth and well-behaved

## Material Selection

The final design uses **Aluminum 7475-T7651**, selected for its balance of strength, ductility, and fracture toughness.

- Young’s Modulus: 10 × 10⁶ psi  
- Poisson Ratio: 0.29  
- Ultimate Strength: ~65 ksi  
- Fracture Toughness, K<sub>IC</sub>: ~46 ksi·√in  

This alloy supports the geometry refinement at the reduced section while maintaining safety margins for all failure modes.

## Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS)

### Boundary Conditions

- The drive end is fully constrained over the upper 0.40 in to represent engagement at the fastener.  
- A torsional load equivalent to **600 in·lbf** is applied at the handle end.

### FEM Results Summary

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Quantity</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Maximum Normal Stress</td><td>133.75 ksi</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Load-Point Deflection</td><td>0.38077 in</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Gauge-Location Strains (x, y, z)</td><td>[−0.3059, −0.30605, 1.055] millistrain</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These results confirm that the reduced section increases strain at the gauge location while keeping stresses within allowable limits for the selected material.

## Sensitivity Prediction (mV/V)

Using a half-bridge Wheatstone configuration, the output is estimated by

<div style="background:#f6f8fa; padding:12px; border-radius:6px;">
V<sub>out</sub> / V<sub>in</sub> ≈ (Gauge Factor × 2 × Strain) / 4  
<br>with Gauge Factor ≈ 2.05 and ε ≈ 1.055 × 10⁻³.
</div>

Using the FEM strain at the gauge location, the predicted sensitivity is:

**Final Sensitivity:** ≥ **1.0 mV/V** at 600 in·lbf  

This satisfies the project requirement and improves on the baseline design by more than a factor of two.

## Strain Gauge Selection

**Selected Gauge:** Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350  
**Type:** Linear foil strain gauge, 350 Ω, Gauge Factor ≈ 2.05  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Gauge Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Grid Length</td><td>3.18 mm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Grid Width</td><td>1.57 mm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pattern Type</td><td>Linear</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The grid dimensions and resistance are compatible with the available mounting area and the strain levels predicted in the FEM model, supporting reliable half-bridge instrumentation at the reduced section.

## Conclusion

The final torque-wrench configuration:

- Meets structural, fatigue, and fracture safety criteria for the specified loading  
- Achieves more than double the baseline strain-gauge sensitivity  
- Produces clean, predictable strain fields suitable for a half-bridge Wheatstone circuit  
- Demonstrates a full workflow from analytical beam theory through CAD, material selection, and FEM verification  

This design process validates the improved geometry as a practical, instrumented torque wrench suitable for experimental use and strain-based torque measurement.
