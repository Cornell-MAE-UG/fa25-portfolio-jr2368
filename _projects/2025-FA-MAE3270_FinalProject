## Project Overview

This project involved designing an instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench rated for  
600 in·lbf, integrating analytical calculations, CAD modeling, strain-gauge placement,  
and ANSYS finite-element validation.

The wrench needed to meet:

- Sensitivity requirement of ≥ 1.0 mV/V  
- Yield/brittle failure safety factor X₀ ≥ 4  
- Crack-growth safety factor Xₖ ≥ 2  
- Fatigue safety factor Xₛ ≥ 1.5  
- Compatibility with standard bonded foil strain gauges  
- Manufacturability with consistent strain fields

## Baseline Analysis

Using the assigned baseline dimensions, the following performance metrics were obtained:

- Deflection at the load point: 0.091 in  
- Maximum bending stress: 12.8 ksi  
- Strain at gauge: 375 µε  
- Estimated output for a half-bridge: 0.38 mV/V  

### Baseline Safety Factors

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Failure Mode</th><th>Safety Factor</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Static Strength</td><td>28.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Crack Growth</td><td>2.95</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fatigue</td><td>8.98</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Although structurally adequate, the baseline design did not meet the required sensitivity threshold and therefore required redesign.

## Improved Final Design

The redesigned geometry incorporated:

- A reduced cross-section to increase measurable strain  
- Flat, accessible surfaces for gauge bonding  
- Maintenance of yield, fatigue, and fracture safety factors  
- Geometric refinement based on FEM strain-field validation

## Material Selection

The selected alloy was:

### Aluminum 7475-T7651

- Young’s Modulus: 10 × 10⁶ psi  
- Poisson Ratio: 0.29  
- Ultimate Strength: ~65 ksi  
- Fracture Toughness (K<sub>IC</sub>): ~46 ksi√in  

This material provided favorable fatigue resistance and toughness while enabling a narrower reduced section for controlled strain amplification.

## Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS)

### Boundary Conditions

- Drive end fully constrained over the upper 0.40 in  
- Applied torsional loading equivalent to 600 in·lbf

## Sensitivity Prediction (mV/V)

Using a half-bridge Wheatstone configuration, the estimated output was computed as:

<div style="background:#f6f8fa; padding:12px; border-radius:6px;">
V<sub>out</sub> / V<sub>in</sub> ≈ (Gauge Factor × 2 × Strain) / 4  
<br>Using GF ≈ 2.05 and ε ≈ 1.055 × 10⁻³  
</div>

### Final Sensitivity  
≥ 1.0 mV/V at 600 in·lbf  
This satisfies the project requirement.

## Strain Gauge Selection

**Selected Gauge:** Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350  
**Type:** Linear foil strain gauge, 350 Ω, Gauge Factor ≈ 2.05  

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Gauge Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Grid Length</td><td>3.18 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grid Width</td><td>1.57 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pattern Type</td><td>Linear</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This gauge was selected based on compatibility with the redesigned mounting surface and the predicted FEM strain distribution.

## Conclusion

The final torque-wrench configuration:

- Meets all structural, fatigue, and fracture safety criteria  
- Achieves more than double the baseline sensitivity  
- Produces well-defined strain fields for half-bridge instrumentation  
- Integrates CAD, materials engineering, strain-gauge application, and FEM validation into a unified design workflow
