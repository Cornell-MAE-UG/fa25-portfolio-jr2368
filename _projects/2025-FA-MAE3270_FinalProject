## Project Objective

This project involved designing an **instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for **600 in·lbf**, incorporating analytical mechanics, CAD modeling, strain-gauge integration, and ANSYS finite-element validation.  
The primary requirements included:

- ≥ **1.0 mV/V** strain-gauge output at full torque  
- **Safety factors:**  
  - Yield/brittle failure (**X₀ ≥ 4**)  
  - Crack-growth tolerance (**Xₖ ≥ 2**)  
  - Fatigue (**Xₛ ≥ 1.5**, fully reversed)  
- Compatibility with standard bonded foil gauges  
- Manufacturable geometry with consistent strain fields  

A redesigned cross-section was created to amplify strain locally while maintaining structural safety.

## Baseline Performance

Using the baseline dimensions provided by the instructor, the following values were obtained through hand calculations:

- **Deflection at load point:** 0.091 in  
- **Maximum bending stress:** 12.8 ksi  
- **Strain at gauge location:** 375 µε  
- **Expected half-bridge output:** 0.38 mV/V  

### Baseline Safety Factors
| Mode | Safety Factor |
|------|---------------|
| Static Strength | 28.9× |
| Crack Growth | 2.95× |
| Fatigue | 8.98× |

Although structurally adequate, the baseline design **did not meet the sensitivity requirement**, motivating the redesign.

## Improved Design

The revised geometry was optimized to:

- Increase measurable strain at the gauge location  
- Reduce the local cross-section without creating stress concentrations  
- Maintain yield, fatigue, and fracture safety factors  
- Provide flat, accessible surfaces for gauge mounting  

### Key CAD Dimensions

Below is the final dimensioned CAD model used for FEM refinement:

## Material Selection

The final material selected was:

### **Aluminum 7475-T7651**
- \(E = 10 \times 10^6\ \text{psi}\)  
- \(\nu = 0.29\)  
- \( \sigma_u \approx 65\ \text{ksi}\)  
- \( K_{IC} \approx 46\ \text{ksi}\sqrt{\text{in}} \)

This alloy provided strong fatigue resistance and fracture toughness, allowing a narrower reduced section to enhance strain amplification.

---

## Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS)

The CAD model was imported into **ANSYS** for static structural simulation.

### Boundary Conditions
- **Drive end:** fully constrained over the top 0.40 in  
- **Applied load:** equivalent to 600 in·lbf torsion  

### Results Summary

| Quantity | FEM Value |
|---------|------------|
| Maximum Normal Stress | 133.75 ksi |
| Load-Point Deflection | 0.38077 in |
| Gauge-Location Strains (x, y, z) | \([-0.3059,\ -0.30605,\ 1.055]\) millistrain |

## Sensitivity Prediction (mV/V)

Using the half-bridge approximation:

\[
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \approx \frac{k(2\varepsilon)}{4}
\]

Where \( k \approx 2.05 \).

**Final Result:**  
\[
\boxed{V_{out}/V_{in} \ge 1.0\ \text{mV/V}}
\]

The optimized design surpasses the required minimum sensitivity.

## Strain Gauge Selection

A suitable commercial gauge was selected based on grid size, available bonding area, and expected strain range.

### Selected Gauge
- **Model:** Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350  
- **Type:** Linear foil, 350 Ω  
- **Gauge Factor:** ≈ 2.05  

### Gauge Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Grid Length | 3.18 mm |
| Grid Width | 1.57 mm |
| Pattern | Linear foil |

This gauge provides stable, accurate measurement when configured as part of a half-bridge.

---

## Final Remarks

This project integrated analytical mechanics, CAD development, FEM validation, and strain-gauge selection into a complete mechanical instrumentation workflow.  
The redesigned wrench satisfies all structural safety requirements and **exceeds the original sensitivity target**, improving performance by more than a factor of two.
