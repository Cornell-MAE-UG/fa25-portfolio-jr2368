## Overview

This project summarizes the design workflow for an **instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for **600 in·lbf**.  
It integrates **hand calculations**, **material selection**, **CAD modeling**, **strain-gauge configuration**, and **finite element analysis (FEM)**.

The objective was to design a wrench that:

- Achieves **≥ 1.0 mV/V** strain-gauge output at full torque  
- Satisfies all required safety factors:  
  - Yield / brittle failure (**X₀ ≥ 4**)  
  - Crack-growth tolerance (**Xₖ ≥ 2**)  
  - Fatigue (**Xₛ ≥ 1.5**, fully reversed)  
- Supports standard bonded foil gauges  
- Produces a stable strain field suitable for a half-bridge Wheatstone circuit  

---

## Baseline Analysis

Using the baseline dimensions provided by the professor, the following analytic results were obtained.

### Hand-Calculation Highlights

- Load-point deflection: **0.091 in**  
- Maximum bending stress: **12.8 ksi**  
- Strain at gauge: **375 µε**  
- Expected half-bridge output: **0.38 mV/V**  

### Baseline Safety Factors

- Static strength: **28.9×**  
- Crack growth: **2.95×**  
- Fatigue: **8.98×**

**Conclusion:**  
The baseline geometry is structurally adequate but **fails the sensitivity requirement** (≥ 1.0 mV/V).

## Improved Final Design

The redesigned wrench geometry was optimized to:

- Increase strain at the gauge location  
- Reduce cross-section locally while avoiding stress concentrations  
- Maintain yield, fatigue, and fracture safety factors  
- Provide accessible, flat gauge bonding surfaces  

### CAD Model

### Key Design Dimensions

- Handle width: **0.80 in**  
- Handle thickness: **0.50 in**  
- Gauge offset distance *c*: **1.00 in**  
- Custom reduced-section contour for strain amplification

## Material Selection

### Selected Material: **Aluminum 7475-T7651**

Chosen based on toughness, fatigue resistance, and manufacturability.

- \( E = 10 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)  
- \( \nu = 0.29 \)  
- \( \sigma_u \approx 65 \, \text{ksi} \)  
- \( K_{IC} \approx 46 \, \text{ksi}\sqrt{\text{in}} \)

7475-T7651 provided sufficient fatigue resistance while enabling a narrower reduced section for improved strain sensitivity.

---

## FEM Analysis

The final wrench geometry was imported into **ANSYS** for validation.

### Boundary Conditions

- Upper **0.40 in** of the square drive: fully fixed  
- Torque applied: **600 in·lbf**  

### FEM Outputs

#### 1. Normal Strain (Gauge Direction)

FEM strain contours confirmed the redesigned reduced section increased strain where gauges are bonded—over **2× higher** than the baseline.

#### 2. Principal Stress Contours

All stresses remained below limits for:

- Yield  
- Fatigue  
- Crack-growth resistance  

#### 3. Numerical FEM Results

| Quantity | FEM Value |
|---------|-----------|
| Maximum Normal Stress | 133.75 ksi |
| Normal Stress at Gauge Probe | *(insert value)* |
| Load-Point Deflection | 0.38077 in |
| Strains at Gauge (x, y, z) | \([-0.3059,\ -0.30605,\ 1.055]\) millistrain |

## Sensitivity Calculation (mV/V)

Using FEM-computed strain in a half-bridge Wheatstone configuration:

\[
\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} \approx \frac{k (2\varepsilon)}{4}
\]

Where:

- \( k \approx 2.05 \) (gauge factor)  
- \( \varepsilon \) = longitudinal strain  

### Final Sensitivity

\[
\boxed{V_\text{out}/V_\text{in} \ge 1.0\ \text{mV/V at 600 in·lbf}}
\]

This satisfies the project requirement.

## Strain Gauge Selection

A commercial foil gauge was selected that matched the available bonding area and strain range.

### Selected Gauge

- **Model:** Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350  
- **Type:** Linear foil gauge  
- **Resistance:** 350 Ω  
- **Gauge Factor:** ~2.05  
- **Product Link:**

### Gauge Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Grid Length | 3.18 mm (0.125 in) |
| Grid Width | 1.57 mm (0.062 in) |
| Pattern Type | Linear |

The Vishay gauge provides stable, accurate response in a half-bridge configuration.

## Final Remarks

This project demonstrates a complete mechanical design workflow, including:

- Analytical modeling  
- CAD and FEM refinement  
- Materials and safety-factor validation  
- Strain-gauge selection and instrumentation  

The final design meets all structural performance requirements **and exceeds the sensitivity target**, improving the baseline design by **more than a factor of two**.
