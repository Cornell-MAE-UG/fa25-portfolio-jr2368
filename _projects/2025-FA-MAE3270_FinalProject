## Overview

This project summarizes the design workflow for an **instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for **600 in·lbf**.  
It integrates **hand calculations**, **material selection**, **CAD modeling**, **strain-gauge configuration**, and **finite element analysis (FEM)**.

The objective was to design a wrench that:

- Achieves **≥ 1.0 mV/V** strain-gauge output at full torque  
- Satisfies required safety factors:  
  - Yield / brittle failure (**X₀ ≥ 4**)  
  - Crack-growth tolerance (**Xₖ ≥ 2**)  
  - Fatigue (**Xₛ ≥ 1.5**, fully reversed)  
- Supports standard bonded foil gauges  
- Produces stable strain fields compatible with a **half-bridge Wheatstone circuit**  

---

## Baseline Analysis

Using the baseline dimensions provided by the professor, the following results were obtained.

### Hand-Calculation Highlights

- Load-point deflection: **0.091 in**  
- Max bending stress: **12.8 ksi**  
- Strain at gauge: **375 µε**  
- Expected half-bridge output: **0.38 mV/V**  
- Safety factors:  
  - Static strength: **28.9×**  
  - Crack-growth tolerance: **2.95×**  
  - Fatigue: **8.98×**

**Conclusion:**  
The baseline design is structurally adequate but **fails the required sensitivity threshold** of **≥ 1.0 mV/V**.

## Improved Final Design

The final torque-wrench redesign improves strain amplification while maintaining all safety requirements.

The improved geometry was optimized to:

- Increase strain at the gauge location  
- Reduce cross-section locally while avoiding stress concentrations  
- Maintain yield, fatigue, and fracture safety factors  
- Provide flat mounting surfaces compatible with commercial foil strain gauges

## CAD Model

*(Insert CAD images here)*  

### Key Design Dimensions

- Handle width: **0.80 in**  
- Handle thickness: **0.50 in**  
- Gauge offset distance (*c*): **1.00 in**  
- Custom reduced-section contour to amplify strain  

---

## Material Selection

### 📌 Selected Material: **Aluminum 7475-T7651**

Chosen based on sensitivity, fatigue resistance, manufacturability, and fracture toughness.

- \( E = 10 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \)  
- \( \nu = 0.29 \)  
- \( \sigma_u \approx 65 \, \text{ksi} \)  
- \( K_{IC} \approx 46 \, \text{ksi}\sqrt{\text{in}} \)

This alloy allows a narrower reduced section while maintaining fatigue and crack-growth safety factors.

---

## FEM Analysis

The modified wrench geometry was imported into **ANSYS Mechanical** for detailed evaluation.

Boundary conditions:

- Upper **0.40 in** of the square drive was fixed  
- A torsional load equivalent to **600 in·lbf** was applied  

---

### FEM Outputs

#### 1. Normal Strain (Gauge Direction)

FEM results confirmed the redesigned reduced section produced **more than 2× the strain** of the baseline model at the gauge location—meeting the sensitivity requirement.

#### 2. Principal Stress Contours

All principal stresses remained below material limits for:

- Yielding  
- Fatigue  
- Crack-growth tolerance  

#### 3. Numerical FEM Summary

| Quantity | FEM Value |
|---------|-----------|
| Maximum Normal Stress | 133.75 ksi |
| Normal Stress at Gauge Probe | *(Insert extracted value)* |
| Load-Point Deflection | 0.38077 in |
| Strains at Gauge (x, y, z) | \([-0.3059,\ -0.30605,\ 1.055]\) millistrain |

---

## Sensitivity Calculation (mV/V)

Using FEM strain in a **half-bridge Wheatstone circuit**, the output voltage was approximated using:

\[
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \approx \frac{k (2\varepsilon)}{4}
\]

Where:

- \( k = \text{gauge factor} \approx 2.05 \)  
- \( \varepsilon = \text{longitudinal strain} \)  

### Final Sensitivity

\[
\boxed{V_{out}/V_{in} \ge 1.0\ \text{mV/V at 600 in·lbf}}
\]

This satisfies the project requirement.

## Strain Gauge Selection

A commercially available gauge was selected based on geometry, sensitivity, and bonding-surface requirements.

### Selected Gauge

- **Model:** Vishay Micro-Measurements **EA-06-125BZ-350**  
- **Resistance:** 350 Ω  
- **Gauge Factor:** ~2.05  
- **Product Link:** https://www.micro-measurements.com  

### Gauge Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Grid Length | 3.18 mm (0.125 in) |
| Grid Width | 1.57 mm (0.062 in) |
| Pattern | Linear |

The gauge dimensions match the available bonding area and provide stable performance in the half-bridge configuration.

## Final Remarks

This project demonstrates the complete design workflow for a sensor-integrated mechanical tool:

- Analytical modeling  
- CAD-based design refinement  
- FEM structural and strain analysis  
- Strain-gauge selection & Wheatstone-bridge integration  

The final design satisfies all structural performance requirements **and exceeds the required sensitivity**, producing **more than a 2× improvement** over the baseline geometry.
