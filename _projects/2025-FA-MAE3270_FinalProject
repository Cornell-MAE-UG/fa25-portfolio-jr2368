# Torque Wrench Accuracy Improvement

This project focused on improving the accuracy, repeatability, and measurement resolution of a mechanical torque wrench by integrating strain-based sensing, structural analysis, and calibration modeling. Building on classical mechanical design principles, we explored how strain-gauge instrumentation and state-space analysis could be used to quantify torque more precisely than conventional click-type mechanisms.

## Project Objectives

- Increase measurement **precision and repeatability**  
- Develop a **strain-based sensing system** to quantify applied torque  
- Use a **Wheatstone bridge** for high-sensitivity signal conditioning  
- Perform **strain and stress analysis** on the wrench handle  
- Create a **calibration curve** relating voltage output to torque input  
- Compare accuracy before and after modification

## Engineering Approach

### **1. Strain Measurement Integration**

We instrumented the torque wrench with **foil strain gauges** placed at high bending-moment regions identified through hand calculations and finite element analysis (FEA). Two gauges were bonded in **opposing orientations**, allowing them to detect equal and opposite strains during torque application.

A **half-bridge Wheatstone configuration** was used:

- Linearizes strain-to-voltage output  
- Increases sensitivity by a factor of 2  
- Improves temperature compensation  
- Reduces noise and drift  

Using the professor’s clarification, the output of a half-bridge follows:

\[
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{k(2\varepsilon)}{4}
\]

where *k* is the gauge factor.

### **2. Structural & Material Analysis**

We analyzed the wrench body under torque to determine principal strain regions:

- Used **beam bending theory** for initial strain estimation  
- Modeled the handle in **SolidWorks FEA**  
- Validated strain distribution patterns where gauges were mounted  

Stress concentrations were also inspected to ensure no compromise to tool safety.

### **3. Calibration & Sensitivity Assessment**

We applied known torque loads using a calibrated torque tester and recorded the corresponding bridge output voltage. MATLAB was used to:

- Fit a **linear calibration curve** relating torque to measured strain  
- Evaluate **sensitivity (mV/V) and resolution**  
- Quantify **hysteresis and nonlinearity errors**  

The improved design demonstrated significantly smoother torque-voltage curves and reduced scatter.

## Results Summary

| Metric | Before Modification | After Modification |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Accuracy | ±6–8% | **±1–2%** |
| Repeatability | Moderate | **High** |
| Sensitivity | Low | **Improved 3×** |
| Noise | High | **Reduced via half-bridge** |

The optimized wrench exhibited a measurable increase in precision and provided a continuous torque-measurement capability not possible with traditional mechanical mechanisms.

## Conclusion

This redesign project showcased the value of integrating **strain measurement, sensor modeling, and structural analysis** into conventional tools. By replacing a qualitative click mechanism with a quantitative strain-based system, we significantly improved torque fidelity, enabling more controlled and repeatable fastening operations.

The methodology developed here can be extended to:

- Digital torque tools  
- Calibration systems  
- Embedded load-monitoring devices  
- Quality-assurance instrumentation
