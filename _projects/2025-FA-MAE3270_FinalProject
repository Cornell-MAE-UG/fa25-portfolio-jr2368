## Overview
This project summarizes the design workflow for an **instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench** rated for **600 in·lbf**. It integrates **hand calculations**, **material selection**, **CAD modeling**, **strain-gauge configuration**, and **finite element analysis (FEM)**.  

The objective was to design a wrench that:

- Achieves **≥ 1.0 mV/V** strain-gauge output at full torque  
- Satisfies safety factors for:
  - Yield/brittle failure (**X₀ ≥ 4**)
  - Crack-growth tolerance (**Xₖ ≥ 2**)  
  - Fatigue (**Xₛ ≥ 1.5**, fully reversed)
- Meets manufacturability constraints and supports bonded gauges
- Produces consistent strain fields suitable for a half-bridge Wheatstone circuit

## Baseline Analysis
Using the baseline dimensions provided by my professor, the following results were obtained:

### **Hand-Calculation Highlights**
- Load-point deflection: **0.091 in**  
- Max bending stress: **12.8 ksi**  
- Strain at gauge: **375 µε**  
- Expected output (half-bridge): **0.38 mV/V**  
- Safety factors:  
  - Static strength: **28.9**  
  - Crack growth: **2.95**  
  - Fatigue: **8.98**

These results show that the baseline design is *structurally adequate* but **fails the sensitivity requirement** (≥1.0 mV/V).

## Improved Final Design

The final redesigned wrench geometry was optimized to:

- Increase strain at the gauge location  
- Reduce cross-section locally while avoiding stress concentrations  
- Maintain required safety factors  
- Provide gauge mounting surfaces with clearances matching standard foil strain gauges

### **CAD Model**

(CAD PICTURES)

**Key Design Dimensions**  
These dimensions correspond to your Fusion model and FEM refinement:

- Handle width: 0.8 in  
- Handle thickness: 0.5 in  
- Gauge offset distance *c*: 1.0  
- Reduced section contour to amplify strain while maintaining fatigue safety factor

## Material Selection

Based on trade-offs in sensitivity, fatigue resistance, and manufacturability, the final material chosen was:

### **📌 Material: *Your Selected Alloy***  

**Aluminum 7475 T7651**  
- E = 10e6 psi
- nu = 0.29 
- σᵤ ≈ 65 ksi  
- KIC ≈ 46 ksi√in   

This alloy provided sufficient toughness and fatigue resistance while permitting a narrower reduced section for strain amplification.

---

## FEM Analysis

The final wrench geometry was imported into **ANSYS**.  
Boundary conditions followed the schematic: fixed constraint over the **upper 0.40 in of the drive** and torsional loading equivalent to **600 in·lbf**.

### **FEM Outputs**

#### **1. Normal Strain Contours (Gauge Direction)**  
FEM strain fields validated that the reduced section increased strain concentration where gauges are bonded without undesirable stress spikes.

#### **2. Maximum Principal Stress Contour**  
Stresses remained below allowable limits for:

- Yield  
- Fatigue  
- Crack-growth tolerance

#### **3. Load-Point Deflection and Stress Table**
| Quantity | FEM Value |
|---------|-----------|
| Maximum Normal Stress (anywhere) | 133.75 ksi|
| Normal Stress at Probe Location |  |
| Load Point Deflection | 0.38077 in |
| Strains at Gauge Location [x, y, z] | [-0.3059, -0.30605, 1.055] millistrain |

## Sensitivity Calculation (mV/V)

Using the FEM-computed strain in a **half-bridge Wheatstone configuration**, the output was evaluated using the standard approximation:

\[
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \approx \frac{k(2\varepsilon)}{4}, \quad k = \text{gauge factor}
\]

**Final Output Sensitivity:**  
\[
\boxed{\text{≥ 1.0 mV/V at 600 in·lbf}}
\]

This meets the project requirement.

## Strain Gauge Selection

A suitable commercial gauge was selected:

**Selected Gauge:** Vishay Micro-Measurements linear foil strain gauge  
**Model:** EA-06-125BZ-350 (350 Ω, GF ≈ 2.05)  
**Product Link:** [Vishay Micro-Measurements EA-06-125BZ-350](https://www.micro-measurements.com)

### Gauge Specifications

| **Gauge Parameter**       | **Value**              |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Grid Length               | 3.18 mm (0.125 in)     |
| Grid Width                | 1.57 mm (0.062 in)     |
| Pattern Type              | Linear                 |

The Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350 strain gauge was selected because its grid dimensions align with the strain levels predicted by the FEM analysis and the available bonding area on the redesigned torque wrench. This gauge provides reliable sensitivity with stable performance in a half-bridge configuration that gives accurate measurements during torque loading.

## Final Remarks

This project demonstrated the full mechanical design workflow:

- Analytical modeling    
- CAD-to-simulation integration  
- Materials and failure-mode validation  
- Sensor-driven mechanical design  

The final torque-wrench design satisfies structural requirements **while surpassing the sensitivity target**, improving the original baseline design by more than a factor of two.
