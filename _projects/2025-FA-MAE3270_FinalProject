## Project Overview

This project involved designing an instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench rated for  
600 in·lbf, integrating analytical calculations, CAD modeling, strain-gauge placement,  
and ANSYS finite-element validation.

The wrench was required to meet:

- Sensitivity ≥ 1.0 mV/V  
- Yield/brittle failure safety factor X₀ ≥ 4  
- Crack-growth safety factor Xₖ ≥ 2  
- Fatigue safety factor Xₛ ≥ 1.5  
- Compatibility with standard bonded foil strain gauges  
- Manufacturability with consistent, repeatable strain fields  

---

## Baseline Analysis

Using the assigned baseline dimensions, the following performance metrics were calculated:

- Deflection at the load point: 0.091 in  
- Maximum bending stress: 12.8 ksi  
- Strain at gauge: 375 µε  
- Estimated half-bridge output: 0.38 mV/V  

### Baseline Safety Factors

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Failure Mode</th><th>Safety Factor</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Static Strength</td><td>28.9</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crack Growth</td><td>2.95</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fatigue</td><td>8.98</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The baseline design is structurally sound but does not meet the sensitivity requirement, prompting a geometry redesign.

## Improved Final Design

The updated torque-wrench geometry was developed to increase strain at the gauge location while maintaining structural integrity across all safety margins. The redesign alters the cross-section, removes excess material in low-stress regions, and introduces controlled flexibility at the reduced section.

### Key Dimension Changes (Baseline → Final)
- Reduced-section thickness: **0.60 in → 0.40 in**  
- Reduced-section width: **0.50 in → 0.38 in**  
- Gauge pad length: **0.50 in → 0.75 in** (to improve bonding surface and strain uniformity)  
- Fillet radius near transition: **0.10 in → 0.25 in** (to reduce stress concentration factors)  
- Handle length: **18.0 in → 18.5 in** (added length increases bending strain by ~3–4%)  

These changes were all validated analytically and through ANSYS simulation to ensure that stresses remain below allowable limits while strain increases sufficiently to meet the 1.0 mV/V sensitivity requirement.

### Design Objectives Achieved
- Increased strain magnitude at the gauge by over **2.8×**  
- Improved gauge placement surface quality and curvature  
- Maintained required safety factors for yield, fatigue, and fracture  
- Ensured a smooth strain gradient through the reduced section for accurate instrumentation

## Material Selection

The final design uses Aluminum 7475-T7651 due to its balance of ductility, strength, and fracture toughness.

- Young’s Modulus: 10 × 10⁶ psi  
- Poisson Ratio: 0.29  
- Ultimate Strength: ~65 ksi  
- Fracture Toughness (K<sub>IC</sub>): ~46 ksi√in  

This alloy supports the higher strain concentration at the reduced section while maintaining structural reliability.

## Sensitivity Prediction (mV/V)

A half-bridge Wheatstone configuration predicts output using:

<div style="background:#f6f8fa; padding:12px; border-radius:6px;">
V<sub>out</sub> / V<sub>in</sub> ≈ (Gauge Factor × 2 × Strain) / 4  
</div>

With gauge factor 2.05 and strain of 1.055 × 10⁻³:

**Predicted Sensitivity:** ≥ 1.0 mV/V at 600 in·lbf  

This exceeds the required minimum and more than doubles the baseline output.

## Strain Gauge Selection

**Gauge Model:** Vishay EA-06-125BZ-350  
**Type:** 350 Ω linear foil strain gauge  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Gauge Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Grid Length</td><td>3.18 mm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Grid Width</td><td>1.57 mm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pattern Type</td><td>Linear</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The selected gauge matches the reduced-section footprint and the predicted strain distribution.

## Conclusion

The final torque wrench design:

- Meets all structural, fatigue, and fracture requirements  
- Achieves over double the baseline strain-gauge sensitivity  
- Provides clean strain fields appropriate for half-bridge measurement  
- Demonstrates a full analytical-to-FEM engineering workflow  

The improved geometry validates the wrench as an improved instrumented system for torque measurement.
