<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
This project analyzes and controls the pitch dynamics of a Boeing 747-400 using state-space modeling, transfer-function development, and closed-loop PID control. The objective was to create a controller capable of achieving high-fidelity pitch tracking with strict performance constraints, modeling aerodynamic forces, stability derivatives, and actuator behavior. The work draws extensively from aircraft performance data and the University of Michigan Aircraft Pitch Control framework <em>(report reference, page 1)</em> :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
</p>

<p>
The system is modeled using aerodynamic coefficients, geometric parameters, and environmental conditions at cruise altitude. The controller was designed to meet the following operational performance requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Overshoot less than 10%</li>
<li>Rise time less than 2 seconds</li>
<li>Settling time less than 10 seconds</li>
<li>Steady-state error less than 2%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aircraft Model and System Parameters</h2>

<p>
To construct the pitch-dynamics model, the team selected a Boeing 747-400 due to the availability of detailed aerodynamic and geometric specifications <em>(page 2)</em> :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
</p>

<h4>Key Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Mass: 300,000 kg</li>
<li>Planform area: 541.16 m²</li>
<li>Wingspan: 59.63 m</li>
<li>Mean aerodynamic chord: 8.15 m</li>
<li>Pitch inertia \( I_{yy} \): 4.49×10⁷ kg·m²</li>
<li>Cruise speed: 250 m/s</li>
<li>Air density at 35,000 ft: 0.371 kg/m³</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lift and drag coefficients were computed assuming a constant lift coefficient and Oswald efficiency factor (e = 0.7). These values were used to calculate induced drag and the stability derivatives necessary for system development <em>(page 2–3)</em> :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

<h2>System Modeling and Differential Equations</h2>

<p>
Using the aerodynamic relationships and performance constants, the UMich pitch-control ODEs were populated with numerical values. This produced the following system <em>(page 4)</em>:
</p>

<div class="eq-block">
α' = −0.0426 α − 0.1781 q + 0.232 δ<br>
q' = −0.09993 α − 0.1999 q + 0.0203 δ<br>
θ' = 61.35 q
</div>

<p>
These equations form the foundation for both transfer-function development and state-space representation.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Transfer Function Development</h2>

<p>
Applying Laplace transforms yields the relationships among α(s), q(s), θ(s), and the input δ(s). After algebraic manipulation, the pitch transfer function becomes <em>(page 5)</em>:
</p>

<div class="eq-block">
P(s) = Θ(s) / Δ(s) = (1.245s − 1.37) / (s³ + 0.2425s² − 0.00928s)
</div>

<p>
This function characterizes how elevator deflection produces rotational pitch motion.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>State-Space Model</h2>

<p>
From the differential equations, the following state-space matrices were derived <em>(page 6)</em>:
</p>

<div class="eq-block">
A = [ −0.0426  −0.1781   0<br>
      −0.09993 −0.1999   0<br>
       0        61.35    0 ]<br><br>

B = [ 0.232 ; 0.0203 ; 0 ]<br><br>

C = [ 1 0 0 ; 0 1 0 ; 0 0 1 ]<br><br>

D = [ 0 ; 0 ; 0 ]
</div>

<p>
These matrices were implemented in Simulink for dynamic simulation.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Open-Loop System Behavior</h2>

<p>
Before introducing feedback control, the aircraft pitch model behaved as an under-damped, drifting system. As seen in the initial simulation results <em>(page 8)</em>, the pitch angle rises briefly due to the command input but then decays and stabilizes at an incorrect angle due to inadequate natural damping and the absence of corrective action.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Controller Design and PID Tuning</h2>

<p>
A PID controller was added to regulate pitch using elevator deflection. Tuning was performed using Simulink’s built-in auto-tuning tools and manual refinement. The controller achieved all design goals:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rise time: ≈ 1.2 seconds</li>
<li>Overshoot: < 10%</li>
<li>Settling time: 7–8 seconds</li>
<li>Steady-state error: < 2%</li>
</ul>

<p>
The tuned system shows significantly improved dynamic response. The pitch angle closely follows the command reference, stabilizing well within the required timeframe <em>(page 8)</em>.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Closed-Loop Response</h2>

<p>
With the PID controller applied, the aircraft exhibits a smooth, well-damped response <em>(page 9)</em>. Elevator deflection (δ) shows a strong initial correction followed by minor adjustments as the aircraft settles into its commanded pitch angle.
</p>

<p>
This confirms that the selected controller architecture and tuning methodology are appropriate for achieving both transient and steady-state performance expectations for aircraft pitch control.
