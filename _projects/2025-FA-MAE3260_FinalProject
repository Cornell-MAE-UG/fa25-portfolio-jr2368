# Aircraft Pitch Controller

For my System Dynamics course (MAE 3260), I collaborated with Nicholas Schneider, Kat Volkova, and Lea Staller to develop a pitch-control system for a Boeing 747-400. The objective was to design, model, and tune a closed-loop controller capable of regulating aircraft pitch angle under varying dynamic conditions.

## Project Overview

Our approach combined **state-space modeling**, **PID-based feedback control**, and **disturbance rejection**. The model incorporated:

- Longitudinal aircraft equations of motion  
- Trimmed linearized state-space dynamics  
- A PID controller tuned for stability and responsiveness  
- Simulation of step inputs and atmospheric disturbances  

Below is the Simulink model used in our controller architecture:

## Key Engineering Tasks

- **Deriving longitudinal state-space equations**  
- **Constructing a Simulink control architecture**  
- **Tuning PID gains for rise time, overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error**  
- **Testing robustness using disturbance inputs**  
- **Evaluating pitch response performance metrics**  

## Results Summary

Through iterative tuning, we attained:

- Rise time within acceptable performance bounds  
- Minimal overshoot to preserve pitch stability  
- Fast settling time for disturbance rejection  
- Near-zero steady-state error  

This project strengthened my understanding of **feedback control**, **dynamic stability**, **modeling and simulation**, and **real-world aerospace control systems**.
