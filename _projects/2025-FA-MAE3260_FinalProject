<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
This project analyzes and controls the pitch dynamics of a Boeing 747-400 using state-space modeling,
transfer-function development, and closed-loop PID control. The objective was to create a controller
capable of achieving pitch tracking with performance constraints. The modeling work
used aerodynamic stability derivatives, aircraft geometry, and performance data to generate a dynamic
representation of pitch behavior.
</p>

<p>
The controller was required to satisfy the following performance metrics:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Overshoot less than 10%</li>
<li>Rise time less than 2 seconds</li>
<li>Settling time less than 10 seconds</li>
<li>Steady-state error less than 2%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aircraft Model and System Parameters</h2>

<p>
The Boeing 747-400 was selected due to the availability of detailed aerodynamic and geometric specifications,
ensuring a realistic model for pitch dynamics analysis.
</p>

<h4>Key Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Mass: 300,000 kg</li>
<li>Planform area: 541.16 m²</li>
<li>Mean aerodynamic chord: 8.15 m</li>
<li>Wingspan: 59.63 m²</li>
<li>Pitch inertia: 4.49×10⁷ kg·m²</li>
<li>Cruise speed: 250 m/s</li>
<li>Air density at 35,000 ft: 0.371 kg/m³</li>
</ul>

<p>
These values were used to compute lift, drag, and stability derivatives, forming the basis for the differential
equations governing pitch motion.
</p>

<h2>System Modeling and Differential Equations</h2>

<p>
From aerodynamic and stability relationships, the system dynamics were computed as:
</p>

<div class="eq-block">
α' = −0.0426 α − 0.1781 q + 0.232 δ<br>
q' = −0.09993 α − 0.1999 q + 0.0203 δ<br>
θ' = 61.35 q
</div>

<p>
These coupled equations govern angle of attack, pitch rate, and pitch angle, forming the foundation for
transfer-function and state-space model development.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Transfer Function Development</h2>

<p>
Taking the Laplace transform and isolating Θ(s)/Δ(s) yields the pitch transfer function:
</p>

<div class="eq-block">
P(s) = Θ(s) / Δ(s) = (1.245s − 1.37) / (s³ + 0.2425s² − 0.00928s)
</div>

<p>
This transfer function represents how elevator deflection influences pitch response.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>State-Space Model</h2>

<div class="eq-block">
A = [ −0.0426  −0.1781   0<br>
      −0.09993 −0.1999   0<br>
       0        61.35    0 ]<br><br>

B = [ 0.232 ; 0.0203 ; 0 ]<br><br>

C = [ 1 0 0 ; 0 1 0 ; 0 0 1 ]<br><br>

D = [ 0 ; 0 ; 0 ]
</div>

<p>
This representation was implemented in MATLAB and Simulink for dynamic simulation and controller design.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Open-Loop System Behavior</h2>

<p>
The open-loop aircraft model exhibits underdamped behavior, with insufficient natural stability and a slow
return toward equilibrium. Without control input, the pitch angle does not follow command inputs effectively,
highlighting the need for closed-loop compensation.
</p>

</div>

<h2>Controller Design and PID Tuning</h2>

       style="max-width: 85%; height: auto;">
  <p><em>Simulink-based pitch control architecture showing reference tracking and elevator actuation.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
A PID controller was added to regulate pitch using elevator deflection. Initial gains were produced through
Simulink’s auto-tuning algorithms, followed by manual refinement to meet design constraints.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rise time: ≈ 1.2 seconds</li>
  <li>Overshoot: &lt; 10%</li>
  <li>Settling time: 7–8 seconds</li>
  <li>Steady-state error: &lt; 2%</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once tuned, the controller achieved all transient and steady-state requirements. The pitch angle tracks the
commanded input smoothly, while elevator deflection provides stable corrective action during disturbances.
</p>

</div>



<div class="section">

<h2>Closed-Loop Response</h2>

<p>
The closed-loop system demonstrates a well-damped response with rapid convergence to the desired pitch
angle. These characteristics confirm that the PID controller architecture is suitable for improving pitch
stability in large-aircraft applications.
