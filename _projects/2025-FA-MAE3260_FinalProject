# Aircraft Pitch Controller

For my System Dynamics class (MAE 3260), I collaborated with Nicholas Schneider, Kat Volkova, and Lea Staller to model and control the pitch dynamics of a Boeing 747-400 aircraft. Our objective was to design a feedback control system capable of maintaining pitch stability under dynamic flight conditions.

## Project Goals
- Derive longitudinal aircraft dynamics  
- Build a linearized model for controller development  
- Implement and tune a PID controller  
- Run step-response and disturbance simulations  

## Summary
This project strengthened my understanding of stability, feedback control, system identification, and real-world aircraft dynamics. Through iterative tuning and simulation in Simulink, we developed a controller with predictable response characteristics and robust pitch stabilization.
