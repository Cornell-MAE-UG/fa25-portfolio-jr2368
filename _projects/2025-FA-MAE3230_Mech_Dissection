<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
This project presents a fluid-mechanical dissection and qualitative analysis of the
<strong>Stihl BR 700 backpack leaf blower</strong>, a high-performance handheld air-moving device.
The objective was to physically dismantle the system, document its internal components,
and analyze how its geometry and configuration govern airflow generation, acceleration,
and discharge.
</p>

<p>
The dissection was performed to reinforce core concepts from fluid mechanics, including
conservation laws, internal flow behavior, turbomachinery fundamentals, and loss mechanisms
in real-world devices.
</p>

<h2>Device Selection and Relevance to Fluid Mechanics</h2>

<p>
The Stihl BR 700 was selected because it functions as a compact centrifugal flow machine,
combining rotating machinery, confined internal flow passages, and high-Reynolds-number
airflow. The device provides a clear physical example of how mechanical energy is transferred
to a fluid to produce useful momentum and pressure rise.
</p>

<p>
Key fluid-mechanical phenomena exhibited by the device include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Energy transfer from a rotating impeller to airflow</li>
  <li>Radial-to-axial flow redirection</li>
  <li>Internal losses due to friction and turbulence</li>
  <li>Jet formation at the discharge nozzle</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Mechanical Dissection Procedure</h2>

<p>
The leaf blower was fully dismantled using standard hand tools, following safe mechanical
disassembly practices. Components were removed in a systematic sequence to preserve
structural integrity and allow clear observation of internal flow features.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the process, particular attention was paid to components that directly influence
fluid motion, including the intake housing, centrifugal fan, volute casing, and outlet ducting.

The video provides visual context for component geometry, flow pathways, and design features
that are difficult to fully capture through static images alone.
</p>

<h2>Identification of Key Flow Components</h2>

<p>
The primary flow-influencing components identified during the dissection include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inlet Section:</strong> Draws ambient air into the blower with minimal pressure loss</li>
  <li><strong>Centrifugal Impeller:</strong> Transfers mechanical energy to the air, increasing velocity and pressure</li>
  <li><strong>Volute Housing:</strong> Converts kinetic energy into static pressure while guiding flow circumferentially</li>
  <li><strong>Outlet Ducting and Nozzle:</strong> Accelerates and directs airflow into a high-speed jet</li>
</ul>

<p>
The geometry of the impeller blades and volute directly controls flow acceleration,
pressure rise, and efficiency.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h2>Flow Pathway Analysis</h2>

<p>
Air enters axially through the intake and is redirected radially outward by the rotating
impeller. As the air moves through the volute, its velocity is partially converted into
pressure before being redirected toward the outlet duct.
</p>

<p>
Potential regions of flow separation and recirculation were observed near sharp turns
and sudden cross-sectional changes, particularly within the volute and outlet transition.
These regions contribute to aerodynamic losses and reduced efficiency.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h2>Application of Fluid Mechanical Principles</h2>

<p>
The blower operation can be explained using fundamental conservation principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conservation of Mass:</strong> Continuity applies throughout the internal flow passages</li>
  <li><strong>Conservation of Momentum:</strong> The impeller imparts momentum to the air, generating thrust</li>
  <li><strong>Conservation of Energy:</strong> Mechanical shaft work is converted into fluid kinetic and pressure energy</li>
</ul>

<p>
The airflow operates at high Reynolds numbers, indicating fully turbulent internal flow.
Losses due to boundary layers, turbulence, and secondary flows play a significant role
in overall performance.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h2>Losses and Efficiency Considerations</h2>

<p>
Major sources of loss identified include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frictional losses along internal walls</li>
  <li>Turbulent dissipation within the volute</li>
  <li>Flow separation at sharp geometric transitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
These losses reduce the fraction of mechanical energy converted into useful airflow.
Design features such as smooth curvature and gradual area changes are critical for
maintaining efficiency.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h2>Safety and Procedural Considerations</h2>

<p>
All disassembly steps were conducted with the device powered off, cooled, and free of fuel.
Personal protective equipment was used to mitigate risks associated with sharp edges and
stored mechanical energy.
</p>

</div>

<h2>Reflection on Fluid Mechanical Phenomena</h2>

<p>
This dissection reinforced the relationship between mechanical design and fluid behavior.
Observing internal components firsthand provided clarity on how theoretical concepts
translate into practical engineering solutions.
</p>

<p>
The project highlighted discrepancies between idealized flow assumptions and real-world
performance, particularly regarding losses and non-uniform flow structures.
</p>

</div>


<div class="section">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The fluid mechanical dissection of the Stihl BR 700 demonstrated how centrifugal machinery,
internal flow passages, and geometric design collectively govern airflow generation.
This project strengthened practical understanding of turbomachinery and internal flow
mechanics beyond what is achievable through theory alone.
