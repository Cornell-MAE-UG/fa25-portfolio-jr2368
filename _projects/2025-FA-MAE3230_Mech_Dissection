  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>
    This project documents a fluid mechanical dissection of the Stihl BR 700 leaf blower, treated as a compact
    turbomachinery system in which chemical energy is converted into shaft work and ultimately into airflow
    momentum and pressure rise. The assignment required a hands-on teardown, identification of key flow components,
    and an engineering interpretation of how geometry, losses, and operating conditions influence performance.

    The dissection video is embedded below and serves as the primary visual record of the teardown process and
    component-level observations.

  <h2>Selection and Overview of the Device</h2>

  <p>
    The Stihl BR 700 was selected because it clearly exhibits fluid mechanical behavior associated with fans and
    internal flow devices: an inlet region, an impeller-driven pressure rise, a volute for flow collection and
    pressure recovery, and an outlet/nozzle region where momentum is delivered to the environment. Its compact size,
    accessible housing, and well-defined flow path make it appropriate for a component-level dissection.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;">Functional Objective</h3>
  <p>
    The primary function is to generate a high-velocity air jet. From a fluid mechanics perspective, the objective is
    to increase the fluid’s mechanical energy (pressure and kinetic energy) through rotating machinery and then
    discharge that energy as momentum.

  <h2>Detailed Dissection and Analysis</h2>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">Physical Disassembly</h3>
  <p>
    The device was dismantled to expose the flow-generating and flow-guiding components. The teardown focused on
    revealing how the blower’s geometry supports stable intake, efficient pressure rise, and controlled discharge.
    Observations during disassembly were used to infer likely regions of separation, mixing, and loss generation.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;">Key Flow Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inlet/Intake Path:</strong> establishes the incoming flow conditions and influences inlet losses.</li>
    <li><strong>Impeller/Fan Stage:</strong> adds energy to the flow through rotating blades and induced swirl.</li>
    <li><strong>Volute:</strong> collects flow from the impeller and converts swirl/velocity into pressure rise.</li>
    <li><strong>Outlet/Nozzle Region:</strong> conditions the flow for discharge and determines delivered momentum.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;">Flow Pathway Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    The primary flow pathway begins at the inlet, accelerates through the impeller, and transitions into the volute
    where pressure recovery and mixing occur before discharge. Geometric transitions and curvature suggest potential
    regions of boundary-layer growth, secondary flow, and localized separation—particularly at abrupt area changes and
    tight turns.

  <h2>Application of Fluid Mechanical Principles</h2>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">Governing Concepts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conservation of mass:</strong> continuity across inlet, impeller, volute, and discharge sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Conservation of momentum:</strong> relationship between discharge jet and delivered thrust/momentum.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy transfer:</strong> mechanical energy addition via rotating blades and pressure recovery in the volute.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;">Non-Dimensional Context</h3>
  <p>
    While exact operating conditions vary with throttle setting and loading, the blower operates in a regime where
    inertial effects dominate and the internal flow is expected to be turbulent. In that context, Reynolds number,
    pressure/flow coefficients, and loss coefficients are the appropriate tools for interpreting performance trends
    and efficiency limitations.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Losses, Efficiency, and Design Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    The primary performance penalties in a compact blower system are expected to arise from inlet losses,
    blade passage losses, mixing losses in the volute, and discharge losses due to non-uniform velocity profiles and
    turbulence. Additional losses occur through leakage paths, surface roughness, and unsteady interaction between the
    impeller outflow and the volute collection region.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;">Potential Design Improvements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Smoother geometric transitions to reduce separation and secondary-flow formation.</li>
    <li>Volute refinement to improve pressure recovery and reduce circumferential non-uniformity.</li>
    <li>Outlet conditioning to reduce swirl and improve jet uniformity at discharge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety and Procedural Controls</h2>

  <p>
    Disassembly was performed with the device powered off and stabilized, with attention to sharp edges, fastener
    control, and safe handling of engine and fuel-system components. Component removal was sequenced to prevent
    damage to mating surfaces and to ensure the flow-path geometry could be documented accurately.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mechanical teardown:</strong> I helped disassemble the <strong>volute</strong>, <strong>engine</strong>, and
      <strong>carburetor</strong>, focusing on how each subsystem supports airflow generation, pressure rise, and overall performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Presentation Contributions:</strong> I introduced the product and provided an overview of the fluid mechanical
      concepts addressed in the video, framing the device as a compact turbomachinery system governed by conservation laws and loss mechanisms.
