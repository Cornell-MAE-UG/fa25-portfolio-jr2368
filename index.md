My name is **Justice Rose**, and I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student with a strong focus on innovation, operational excellence, and mission-driven leadership. My academic and professional interests center on advanced manufacturing, automation, and sustainable production methods within the automotive engineering sector.

I grew up in Yokosuka, Japan, where my father served in the U.S. Navy. Being raised in an international community shaped my appreciation for service, discipline, and cross-cultural collaboration. These experiences continue to influence how I approach teamwork, technical problem-solving, and leadership.

Beyond academics, I serve in **Naval ROTC** and will commission as a **Surface Warfare Officer**. This journey has strengthened my discipline, strategic mindset, and commitment to high-performance environments. I am inspired by roles where engineering, leadership, and operational strategy intersect.
