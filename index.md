      My name is <strong>Justice Rose</strong>, and I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student with a strong focus on innovation, operational excellence, and mission-driven leadership. My academic and professional interests center on advanced manufacturing, automation, and sustainable production within the automotive engineering sector.

      I grew up in Yokosuka, Japan, where my father served in the U.S. Navy. Being raised in an international community shaped my appreciation for service, discipline, and cross-cultural collaboration. These experiences influence how I approach teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership.

      Beyond academics, I serve in <strong>Naval ROTC</strong> and will commission as a <strong>Surface Warfare Officer</strong>. This journey has strengthened my discipline, strategic mindset, and commitment to high-performance environments. I am inspired by roles where engineering, leadership, and operational strategy intersect.
