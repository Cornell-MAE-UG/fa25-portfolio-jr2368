## About Me

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4993111-3bc9-42a8-b63f-2e1d2b78c1b2" alt="Rose_Headshot" width="250"/>

My name is Justice Rose, and I am a third-year mechanical engineering student with a strong commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and mission-driven leadership. I am deeply interested in the automotive manufacturing sector, particularly in how advanced engineering practices, modern automation, and sustainable production methods are shaping the future of the industry.  

I grew up in Yokosuka, Japan, where my father served in the U.S. Navy. Being raised in a diverse, international community instilled in me an appreciation for service, discipline, and cultural awareness. Those early experiences shaped my perspective on teamwork, global engagement, and contributing to something larger than myself.

Beyond academics, I am an active member of Naval ROTC and will be commissioning as a Surface Warfare Officer. Through this journey, I have developed a disciplined work ethic, a service-oriented mindset, and a strong appreciation for collaborative, high-performance environments. I am motivated by opportunities where engineering, leadership, and strategic problem-solving intersect, and I continually seek experiences that broaden my technical foundation and strengthen my ability to serve others.

I am driven by the belief that meaningful impact comes from purpose, preparation, and perseverance—and I look forward to contributing to organizations and teams that share these values.
