## Aircraft Pitch Controller

For my System Dynamics class, MAE 3260, I, alongside Nicholas Schneider, Kat Volkova, and Lea Staller, designed performance requirements of a Boeing 747-400 aircraft for pitch control, and built a Simulink model with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.
